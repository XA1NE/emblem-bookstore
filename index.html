      <h2>Valuing Books</h2>
      <div class="offer-text">
        <p>
          If you possess books you wish to sell then a formal valuation the most appropriate course of action.
          Emblem undertakes written valuations for insurance purposes or personal interest.
          We can appraise a single books or collections. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          If you wish to have a book valued, a free initial verbal assessment of whether the
          book is likely to have sufficient value to merit a full valuation is recommended.
          If you decide to go ahead with the valuation, Emblem will provide you with an estimate
          of the cost before the valuation is carried out in full.
          Fees for valuation work are charged at a half day rate of £300.
